# woRdcomplex-2.1
R script to determine word complexity version 2.1

Run the script locally in R/Rstudio. Text input should be in .txt files and include orthographic transcriptions (e.g. gloss or ordinary typed English)  of words, sentences, paragraphs, etc.

A Shiny app is also available at https://github.com/unccard/woRdcomplex-2.1 or https://unccard.shinyapps.io/shiny-woRdcomplex-2/.

Word Complexity Measure (WCM) is calculated as described in Stoel-Gammon (2010), based on lookup from a database including standard syllabified transcriptions for American English (cmudict.0.6d.syl; Bartlett et al., 2009) and word frequency measures from the SUBTLEX-US dictionary (Brysbaert & New, 2009). Word frequencies are displayed in Zipf units (van Heuven et al 2014), a logarithmic scale defined as log10(word frequency in words per billion), with distribution from approximately 1 (very low frequency) to 7 (high frequency function words, articles, etc.).
